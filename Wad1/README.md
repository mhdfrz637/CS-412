Description:
This repository contains the final project for the CS-412 course, a web-based application designed with user authentication, database integration, and robust functionality to handle multiple users. The application is structured to ensure clean, maintainable code and adheres to industry-standard practices for naming conventions, file organization, and error handling.

Features:
-User Authentication: Secure login and registration functionality with encrypted password storage.
-Database Integration: All user actions are saved to a database for persistent storage.
-Multi-User Support: Handles multiple users simultaneously with proper session management.
-Error-Free Execution: Code is clean and functions correctly with no console errors.
-Responsive UI: Designed for usability across different devices and browsers.

Technology Stack
-Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-Backend: Node.js, Express.js
-Database: MongoDB
-Authentication: Passport.js or JWT (mention the one used)
-Tools and Libraries:
  NPM packages (e.g., dotenv, bcrypt, etc.)
  Postman (for API testing)
  GitHub for version control
